# Banking_App
 This will be a portfolio project where I create a fullstack application for banking/financial planning. Users will be able to connect their bank accounts and view their transaction history using Plaid API for the banking functionality. This project will use React Native with TypeScript, Next.js, and Appwrite to build the backend.
